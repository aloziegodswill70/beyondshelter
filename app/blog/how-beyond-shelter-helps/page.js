          Beyond Shelter UK provides more than accommodation. We offer emotional
          support, counselling, crisis intervention, and long-term recovery guidance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Survivors of abuse receive confidential assistance, while homeless
          individuals are connected to housing, meals, and social support.

        <p>
          Our goal is long-term stability — not just short-term relief.
