          <strong>Beyond Shelter UK</strong> was created to provide immediate,
          compassionate, and confidential support for people facing homelessness,
          domestic abuse, exploitation, and crisis situations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Across the UK, thousands of individuals sleep without shelter or remain
          trapped in unsafe environments. Beyond Shelter exists to restore dignity,
          safety, and hope to those people.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our mission is simple but urgent: ensure that no one is left alone when
          facing danger, homelessness, or abuse.
